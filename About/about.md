## Education
### MBO (2011-2015)
After my highschool the first study I did was digital media design(MBO) at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. That’s a direction where I mainly did stuff like web design and web development. That’s also where I first got my hands on programming, where my main thing was building websites using html, css, php, integrating Wordpress as backend. I also did some designing with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator at the time.

### HBO (2016-2020)
I liked creating websites, but I really wanted to delve deeper into backend and just the technical side of things, so after that I decided to study further and enrolled in Computer Science(Informatica) at Hogeschool Rotterdam. This is where I really learned the fundamental things like: data structures, object oriented programming, databases, algorithms and the common related things. In the end I decided to specialise in AI, machine learning where I learned to train and deploy deep learning absed image recognition models in my interships. And the subjects that go with it like computer vision, math(linear algebra, calculus, matrix operations).

## Work
After I graduated I got a job at the place where I did an internship for machine learning where I ended up working for 5 years learning a lot more. I started out with training and deploying various types of image recognition models (classification, bounding box, instance-segmentation), that were used to automatically detect building elements and materials on images. Later on I also did a lot of machine learning engineering work, and helped build pipelines to accommodate the full process from labeled data, processed datasets, to training models on cloud services, to deploying them. Aside form that I also built a decent foundation in software engineering and worked on data pipelines, and event based pipelines. Here I also grasped the concepts of proper testing and use of classes, making code scalable, utilizing cloud AWS services(lambdas, cloud gpu), and of course just working with other programmers to build things together.

## Ambitions
### Graphics programming / 3D
While I like data science and software engineering a lot, I wasn’t fully satisfied yet in terms of the products that I was building/working on. Creating interactive 3D environments is what gave that full satisfaction. During my data science job I did get to work with some interesting 3D data like point clouds, geometries, but not so much creating 3D applications myself. So this is something I started doing myself the last years. I started with Unity creating some 2D games, and moved on to creating 3D games. From that I moved on Unreal Engine as it was c++ based, and one of the other big engines of course, that I also build a couple small 3D games with. I liked it a lot, and was still interested further in how these things worked under the hood. So from there I dived a level deeper and started with graphics programming learning openGL and all the areas graphics programming has to offer, which are all super interesting.
