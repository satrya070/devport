Anything 3D.

Education
After my highschool the first study I did was digital media design(MBO) at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. That’s a direction where I mainly did stuff like web design and web development. That’s also where I first got my hands on programming, where my main thing was building websites using html, css, php, integrating Wordpress as backend. I also did some designing with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator at the time.

I really liked creating websites, but I really wanted to delve deeper into backend and the technical stuff so after that I decided to continue studying further and enrolled in Computer Science at Hogeschool Rotterdam. Here is where I really learned the fundamental things like: data structures, object oriented programming, databases, algorithms and related. In the end I decided to specialise in AI, machine learning where I learned to train and deploy image recognition models with deep learning. And the subjects that go with it like computer vision, math(linear algebra, calculus).

Work
After I graduated I got a job at the place where I did an internship for machine learning where I ended up working for 5 years learning a lot more. I started out with training and deploying various types of image recognition models (classification, bounding box, instance-segmentation), that were used to automatically detect building elements and materials on image data. Later on I also did a lot of machine learning engineering work, and helped build pipelines to accommodate the full process from labeled data to training models on cloud services to deploying and managing them. I also built a decent foundation in software engineering and worked with building data pipelines, and event based pipelines. Here I also grasped the concepts of proper testing and use of classes, making code scalable, utilizing cloud AWS services(lambdas, cloud gpu), and of course working with other programmers to build things together.

Graphics programming / 3D
While I really liked data science and software engineering I wasn’t fully satisfied in terms of the end products that I was building/working on. Creating a real environment gave me satisfaction like nothing what I programmed before. During work I did get to work with some interesting 3D data like utilize point clouds, geometry, but not the point of creating 3D things myself. So this is something I started doing myself first with Unity where I created some 2D games but and ended then also 3D games. From that I moved on Unreal Engine as it is somewhat as a more advanced version and made some games there. I liked it a lot, but was still interested in how these things worked on a deeper level. I also didn’t want to restrict myself to in the form of games but implementing anything 3D was just fun. So that’s when I stepped into learning openGL and 3D graphics.
