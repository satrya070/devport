## Motivation
The first time I did anything with gamedevelopment was when I had to create a boardgame as a project for school, when I was studying computer science. The engine we had to use was Pygame. I had a lot fun doing it, but didn't make a game again for a long time as my focus was mostly on learning to build more general applications like apps and websites.

In my heart I always thought game development the coolest thing ever, but for the longest of time I'd always been intimated to learn it as game developement always had that stigma of being a hard discipline to learn, even by programming standards as it can be a collection of many deep subjects. After a couple years of doing programming on a proffesional level and leveling up my math skills, I felt confident about picking it up. It's a whole other beast to conquer but I truly enjoy the process and know that with (a lot of) effort I can learn it and become good at it.

## Learnings
Pygame, Unity, Unreal
