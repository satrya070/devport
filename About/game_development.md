## Motivation
The first time I did anything with gamedevelopment was when I had to create a boardgame as a project for school, when I was studying computer science. The engine we had to use was Pygame. I had a lot fun doing it, but didn't make a game again for a long time as my focus was mostly on learning to build more general applications like apps and websites.

In my heart I always thought game development the coolest thing ever, but for the longest of time I'd always been intimated to learn it as game development always had that stigma of being a hard/broad discipline to learn, even by programming standards as it can be a collection of many subjects that go deep. After a couple years of doing programming on a proffesional level and leveling up my math skills, I felt confident about picking it up. It's a whole other beast to conquer but I truly enjoy the process and know that with (a lot of) effort I can learn it and become good at it.

## Learnings
I started again with Unity and followed Udemy courses and made a couple simple games with it. This consisted of 2D based games like a top down racer, and platformer based games.

After Unity I also picked up Unreal Engine as those 2 serve as the most popular framework and I wanted to learn c++ anyway. I've followed Unreal udemy courses and started my own small projects like creating a 2.5 platformer.
