## Origins
My name is Satrya and I am based in The Netherlands, The Hague where I've pretty much lived my whole life. My bloodroots lie in Indonesia. I'm a Data Scientist that mostly focusses on building image recognition models with Pytorch. Currently I'm also picking up software and data engineering things, and do game development in my free time.

## Educational background
After high school I studied Digital Media Design (MBO-4) at the Grafisch Lyceum in Rotterdam, where my main focus would be webdevelopment, and did some web designing with tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. In my interships I created websites by creating custom Wordpress themes for clients.

Even tho I liked the designing part, I was definitely more interested in the development part so I wanted to delve much deeper into that aspect. That's when I decided to go study Computer Science(HBO) at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. The technical complexities gave me the challenges that would excite me.

Artificial intelligence and Data Science were the most interesting to me and very much on the rise so I chose to specialise in that area. Fast forward I graduated with a research to automatically detect damaged paint on windowframes, and am now working as a Data Scientist.

## Interests and goals
The two constant things I like and will always focus on improving are programming and math. Both provide me with so insanely much to learn and the challenge that keeps me aroused. Ultimately I think what satisfies me the most is to build things that result in some type of visual environment or world, that people can enter and interact with.
