<h1>Skillset</h1>

<!--My passion lies programming, started with websites at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam.

Then I did Computer Science at Hogeschool Rotterdam, where I specialized in AI machine learning.
Over the years I worked as Data science where I trained deep learning model image recognition models. This is where I learned a lot about image processing, math(linear algebra, matrice operations), and software engineering, cloudcomputing.

While I enjoyed it a lot, there I was still missing something. I was still eager to learn about game develoepr and 3d graphics world in general, and it remained in the back of my head. At some point I just started creating my own projects, and this is definitely the area I enjoy learning the most about.-->
