# Astar algorithm simulation with Unity
---
<div class="intro">
The A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path. This is basically a Dijkstra algorithm, except it uses a heuristic function to find the shortest path faster. To get some more experience with C# and Unity I made a simple visualization/simulation of this algorithm in Unity. It definitely ended up being a good exercise. In this post I will show the simulation, and explain some of the technical bits.

## The Unity application
I'll start off by explaining what all the elements are in the environment. As you can see below the environment is a simple grid where the algorithm's goal is to find the shortest path between the start and end node. The yellow nodes represent the start and end point here. There are dark grey tiles represent walls that the algo can't passed through when traversing the grid. The purple nodes represent tiles that have been traversed and evaluated, but ended up not being part of the shortest path. The red nodes indicate the shortest path that has been found. Below on the left you see an easy case with no walls, and on the right an example where no path to the end node exists at all.

Below you see an example of an easy find that has walls and what it looks like:

And now an example where it's definitely harder to find the path:

## Live tryout demo
To try it out this simulation check out [this](https://satrya070.github.io/AstarWeb){:target="_blank"} page. Note that it's not super refined as it's made showcase the algorithm in a simple way.
### Controls:
- left-click: select starting node
- right-click: mark node as wall
- scrollwheel-click: mark the end node
- enter: start the pathfinding(works if start and end point are selected)

## Technical components
To build the actual grid I used Unity's tilemap system which can be used to create a simple grid, that also has basic functions to be able to manipulate tiles, and get positional data from them. All the input that's needed from the user is the start point, and point, and which blocks should be walls, which the used selects with his/her mouse input. The algorithm is started on the sign of the user, which includes the labeling of all cells with the actions it has performed.

### simple explanation of A*
The algorithm starts by exploring all neighbor nodes/tiles, from the starting tile. For each neighbor node a distance will be estimated (the distance between the start and end point, if the route where to go through this node). All these neighbor nodes get put into a “priority queue”. This priority queue sorts all nodes that get added to it based on their estimated distance, so that the node with the shortest distance gets popped first. Using a queue like that speeds up the process of finding the best path. The maximum number of nodes you could put into this queue is just all the node positions available in the grid (so not walls). The processing of this queue stops when the end node is found, and if the end node is not found after processing the whole queue it means no path exists between the start and end node. This is the algorithm in a nutshell. I won’t be explaining the A* algorithm itself in absolute detail as there are a lot more intricacies which is outside the scope of this post.
