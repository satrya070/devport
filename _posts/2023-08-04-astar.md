# Astar algorithm simulation with Unity
---
The Astar is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path. This is basically a Dijkstra algorithm, except it uses an heuristic function to find the shortest path faster. To get some more experience with C# and Unity I decided to make a simple visualization/simulation of this algorithm in Unity. In reality it still took a while tho üòÖ, but it definitely ended up being a very good exercise. In this post I will show the simulation, and explain the technical elements a bit.

## The Unity application
As you can see below it's a simple grid where the algorithm's goal is to find the shortest path between the start and end node(the yellow nodes) and visualize that. There are grey tiles which represent walls that cannot be passed through when finding the shortest path. The pink nodes represent tiles that have been processed/searched but ended up not being part of the given solution of the shortest route. The red nodes indicate the shortest path that has been found. On the left you see the most easiest case with no walls, and on the right an sample where no path can be found to the end node.

Below you see an example of an easy find that has walls and what it looks like:

And now an example where it's definitely harder to find the path:

## Live tryout demo
To try it out this simulation check out [this](https://satrya070.github.io/AstarWeb){:target="_blank"} page. Note that it's not super refined as it's made showcase the algorithm in a simple way.
### Controls:
- left-click: select starting node
- right-click: mark node as wall
- scrollwheel-click: mark the end node
- enter: start the pathfinding(works if start and end point are selected)

## Technical components
For the grid I used Unity's tilemap system which can be used to create a simple grid, and has functionality to manipulate tiles and get positional information from them for the algorithm to use. 

The algorithm starts by exploring all neighbor nodes/tiles, from the starting tile. For each neighbor node a distance will be estimated (the distance between the start and end point, if the route where to go through this node). All these neighbor nodes get put into a ‚Äúpriority queue‚Äù. This priority queue sorts all nodes that get added to it based on their estimated distance, so that the node with the shortest distance gets popped first. Using a queue like that speeds up the process of finding the best path. The maximum number of nodes you could put into this queue is just all the node positions available in the grid (so not walls). The processing of this queue stops when the end node is found, and if the end node is not found after processing the whole queue it means no path exists between the start and end node. This is the algorithm in a nutshell. I won‚Äôt be explaining the A* algorithm itself in absolute detail as there are a lot more intricacies which is outside the scope of this post.
