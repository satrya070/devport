# 3D spacegame in Unity
---
<div class="intro">
This project is a 3D action space game that I made in Unity. I wanted to create a vehicle controlled type of game, and space environments are always awesome to me, so I decided to make a basic space game where the player “is” a spaceship that contains 3 short levels with different elements. The focus of this project was on the functional aspect, making a good working game, with all the mechanics that belong to it. Note that the visual aspect was not the focus for me, and that I almost didn’t make any of the assets. I did of course still try to make it look decent. In the post I will go in depth on all the elements.

Tools
<ul>
    <li>Unity 3D</li>
    <li>C#</li>
</ul>


For a brief overview to get a general sense, I will list the mechanics and component I developed here:
- basic shipmovement with unity's physics system
- lasershooting
- meteors moving toward a target
- health and damage system
- Implementaing AI ships
- level navigating/transitioning: (pass fail codition)
- manager music
