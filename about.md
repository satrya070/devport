## Origin
Hi there, my name is Satrya and I am based in The Netherlands, The Hague where I've pretty much lived my whole life, and my family roots lie in Indonesia. Currently I am a Data Scientist that mostly focusses on building image recognition models with Pytorch. I also work on data and software engineering pipelines, which I do more on the side.

## Background
After high school I studied Digital Media Design(MBO-4) at the Grafisch Lyceum in Rotterdam, in which I learned a lot about digital designing tools like Photoshop, Illustrator. As my main direction I chose to into websites, where I learned a lot about web development and web design. In my interships I created custom Wordpress themes for clients.

Even tho I liked both designing and development, I was definitely more interested in the technical part. This to point where I wanted to learn more about complex applications, so I decided to study Computer Science(HBO) at Hogeschool Rotterdam. The technical complexities gave me the challenges I was looking for. As AI/Data Science can be very challenging and interesting, I decided to specialise in that direction. Fast forward I graduated with a research to automatically detect damaged paint on windowframes, and am now working as a Data Scientist.

## Interests and goals
The things I like to focus on at all times are Math and Programming.
