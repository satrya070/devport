Hello, my name Satrya and .. interest data science, game dev, more about me here. This just a place where I'd just like to save some of the things that I have been doing and found interesting. Plus it's just a very good exercise to document these things to reinforcing my knowledge on these topics.

<!-- This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details. -->

<!-- If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. -->
